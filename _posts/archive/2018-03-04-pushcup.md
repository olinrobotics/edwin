# Push Cup Game

### Description
<p>Push Cup is a simple game designed by Connor Novak during the Fall 2016
semester. The game is played on a white playing field with a red SOLO cup and a
black dot representing the goal. Edwin and the player take turns pushing the
cup, the player pushing the cup off of the goal and Edwin returning the cup to
a position covering the goal.</p>

### Purpose
<p>Push Cup was designed to demonstrate Edwin and a human interacting safely and
cooperatively within a physical space. Edwin was able to understand when the
human was interacting with the cup and when they were finished, thus
demonstrating a concept of "turns".</p>
